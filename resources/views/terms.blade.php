                <h2>2. RISK WARNING</h2>
                <p>
                    2.1 Buying, selling and investing in cryptocurrencies can be
                    risky. The risk of loss in trading or holding cryptocurrency can
                    be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether
                    trading or holding cryptocurrency is suitable for you in light of
                    your financial condition. In considering whether to trade or hold
                    cryptocurrency, you should be aware that the price or value of
                    cryptocurrency can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even
                    fall to zero. <br />
                    <br />2.2 The cryptocurrencies market information relating to the
                    past performance of an investment is not necessarily a guide to
                    its performance in the future. The value of investments or income
                    from them may go down as well as up. Like stocks and shares as
                    well, cryptocurrencies are valued from second to second, their bid
                    and offer value fluctuates sometimes widely. The degrees of
                    fluctuation of prices vary significantly and the value of higher
                    volatility funds may change suddenly. The value of investments may
                    rise or fall due to the volatility of world markets, interest
                    rates and capital values or, for investments held in overseas
                    markets, changes in the rate of exchange in the currency in which
                    the investments are denominated. You may not necessarily get back
                    the amount you invested. <br />
                    <br />2.3 You know and understand cryptocurrency trading also has
                    certain risks which can cause a complete loss to zero. As
                    cryptocurrencies are no official currency and the legal status is
                    still undefined, their legal nature is subject of change under
                    different jurisdictions. Unlike official currencies, which are
                    backed up by governments or other legal entities like the FED, ECB
                    or others, cryptocurrencies are a private currency, generated by
                    all the world. There is no central bank that could take corrective
                    measures to protect the value of the cryptocurrencies at a
                    possible crisis. <br />
                    <br />2.4 You know and understand cryptocurrency trading could be
                    affected by hackers, change of laws, official restrictions,
                    frauds, technical issues, collapse of infrastructure and many
                    other possible threats. <br />

                    your personal information and use, and is not intended to address
                    your particular requirements or to be relied upon in making (or

                    decision, you should obtain appropriate expert independent advice
                    and assess carefully whether your financial background is suitable
                    for trading cryptocurrencies. Your decisions and investments are
                    subject to your personal responsibility.

                <h2>7. FEES</h2>
                <p>
                    7.1 External fees. Every cryptocurrency transaction must be added
                    to the blockchain, the official public ledger of all completed
                    transactions, in order to be considered a successful and valid
                    transfer. The work of validating transactions and adding them to
                    the blockchain is done by miners, which are powerful computers
                    that make up a portion of the network and confirm its
                    transactions. Miners spend vast amounts of computing power and
                    energy doing this for a financial reward: with every block (a
                    collection of transactions) added to the blockchain comes a bounty
                    called a block reward, as well as all fees sent with the
                    transactions that were confirmed and included in the block. For
                    this reason, miners have a financial incentive to prioritize the
                    validation of transactions that include a higher fee. For someone
                    looking to send funds and get a quick confirmation, the
                    appropriate fee to include depends on the cryptocurrency being
                    sent and can vary greatly, depending on a number of factors, such
                    as transaction size and network conditions. Your wallet will
                    automatically calculate the appropriate fee for sending your
                    chosen cryptocurrency. The fee for sending ether is static (you
                    can view the fee for sending ether by clicking “Send” and
                    selecting Ether as the currency), while the fees for sending
                    bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and stellar are dynamic and will be
                    calculated by your wallet after you input the amount you want to
                    send. This article explains bitcoin transaction fees in greater
                    detail. <br /><br />7.2 Internal fees. The Our Digital Exchange
                    shall enable matching of buy and sell orders between Users. The
                    latest information on the time for settlement of any transactions
                    and the costs and fees associated with transactions shall be as
                    published on our Site from time to time. According to our rules,
                    for each user there is a mandatory commission for all deposits
                    (1%), and for all withdrawals (unique for each coin). We trade at
                    a variable percentage above market rate to cover our operating
                    costs and to allow our vendors to make a profit. The trade-off for
                    this is ease of use and the speed of the service - we're not the
                    cheapest, but we try to be the best! Everything depends on the
                    loading of our system and the magnitude of the operation.
                    <br /><br />7.3 Collection-Related Costs. If you fail to pay fees
                    or any other amounts owed to Payward under these Terms and Payward
                    refers your account(s) to a third party for collection, then
                    Payward will charge you the lesser of an 3% collection fee or the
                    maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, to cover Payward's
                    collection-related costs. <br /><br />7.4 At the first withdrawal
                    of funds, users must pay a tax of 3% of the amount of your
                    withdrawal. (One-time)

                <h2>10. TRANSACTIONS ON CRYPTOCURRENCY NETWORKS</h2>
                <p>
                    10.1 When you use your Cryptohouse Account to send or receive
                    cryptocurrency, the transaction must be confirmed and recorded in
                    the public ledger associated with the relevant cryptocurrency
                    network (e.g. the Bitcoin network or the Ethereum network). That
                    cryptocurrency network is solely responsible for verifying and
                    confirming any such transactions. Cryptohouse cannot confirm,
                    cancel or reverse transactions on a cryptocurrency network, other
                    than confirming to you that the network has completed the
                    transaction. <br /><br />10.2 Once submitted to a cryptocurrency
                    network, a transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time
                    pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the network.
                    A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state.
                    Funds associated with transactions that are in a pending state
                    will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your
                    Cryptohouse Wallet balance or be available to you to conduct
                    transactions; When you send cryptocurrency from your Cryptohouse
                    Account, you are authorising us to submit your transaction request
                    to the relevant cryptocurrency network. Once a transaction request
                    has been submitted to the relevant cryptocurrency network, the
                    network will automatically complete or reject the request and
                    neither you or Cryptohouse will be able to cancel or otherwise
                    modify your transaction. Cryptocurrency networks are operated by
                    decentralised networks of independent third parties. They are not
                    owned, controlled or operated by Cryptohouse so we cannot ensure
                    that any transaction details you submit will be confirmed by the
                    relevant cryptocurrency network. You agree that any transaction
                    details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially
                    delayed, by the cryptocurrency network used to process the
                    transaction. <br /><br />10.3 SITE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE THAT:
                    Cryptohouse is not responsible for the operation of any
                    cryptocurrency network’s underlying software protocols and makes
                    no guarantee as to their availability, security, or functionality;
                    the underlying software protocols are subject to sudden changes in
                    operating rules (known as “forks”), and that such forks may
                    materially affect the value, function, and/or name of any
                    cryptocurrency you store in your Cryptohouse Account. Should a
                    fork occur, Cryptohouse may, with or without notice to you,
                    temporarily suspend our operations and, in our sole discretion,
                    decide whether or not to support either branch of the forked
                    protocol entirely; in the event Cryptohouse decides not to support
                    a branch of a forked protocol, you will not be given access to the
                    assets on that fork. Those assets will be securely held by
                    Cryptohouse and we will not buy or sell them.

                    provide to you, any cryptocurrency sent to any receive address

                <p>
                    14.1 We reasonably suspect your Cryptohouse Account to be the
                    subject of an operational or other error, in which case we may be
                    required to suspend access to your account until such time as the
                    error is rectified; we reasonably suspect your Cryptohouse Account
                    has been or is being used in relation to any unlawful, fraudulent
                    or Prohibited Activity, or in breach of these Terms; we reasonably
                    suspect you or your Cryptohouse Account is or has been associated

                    terrorism, fraud, or any other financial crime; we reasonably
                    suspect you of taking any action that Cryptohouse considers to be
                    a circumvention of Cryptohouse'S controls, including but not
                    limited to opening multiple Cryptohouse Accounts; we reasonably
                    suspect your involvement in any attempt to gain unauthorised
                    access to any Cryptohouse Account; your Cryptohouse Account is or
                    appears to be the subject of any legal, regulatory or government
                    process and/or we, in our sole discretion, consider there to be a
                    heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated
                    with your Cryptohouse Account; we are compelled to do so by a
                    prima facie valid subpoena, court order, or other binding order of
                    a government or regulatory authority; your name appears on a
                    government or international body sanctions list. <br /><br />14.2

                    notice of any decision to restrict, suspend or terminate your
                    Cryptohouse Account, unless we are prevented from doing so by any
                    legal or regulatory process or requirement, or where doing so may
                    compromise Cryptohouse’s security and/or risk management
                    procedures. You accept and agree that Cryptohouse is under no
                    obligation to disclose to you the fact of or reason for any
                    decision to restrict, suspend or terminate your Cryptohouse
                    Account, and shall have no liability to you in connection with the
                    restriction, suspension or termination of your Cryptohouse
                    Account. <br /><br />

                    your Cryptohouse Account in accordance with the above, we shall
                    (except where legally obligated not to) return your available
                    cryptocurrency and/or Local Currency balances to you pursuant to
                    the procedure set out below: Cryptocurrency. If you have an
                    available balance of Supported Cryptocurrency in your Cryptohouse

                    cryptocurrency and deposit the value realised from the liquidation
                    into your Local Currency wallet. The Minimum Threshold is
                    USD10.00, or its equivalent in any applicable Supported
                    Cryptocurrency calculated on the day on which the liquidation is
                    performed. We will not send your Supported Cryptocurrency to an
                    alternative cryptocurrency wallet address. Any risk of a negative
                    exchange rate fluctuation shall rest with you and you shall have
                    no claim against Cryptohouse for any losses you may suffer as a
                    result of the liquidation of your available balance of Supported
                    Cryptocurrency.
